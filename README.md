# SSD INFERENCE OPTIMIZED

This repository optimises inference of [NVIDIA's SSD300](https://pytorch.org/hub/nvidia_deeplearningexamples_ssd/). 
This is purely for learning purposes and reimplements most ideas from [Paul Bridger's](https://paulbridger.com/posts/about/) blog on optimising SSD inference from 9FPS to 2530 FPS.
